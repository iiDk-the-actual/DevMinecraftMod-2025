# DevMinecraftMod-2025

## Overview
DevMinecraftMod-2025 is a modn for Gorilla Tag that builds upon Developer9998's original DevMinecraftMod to add features such as placing and breaking blocks. Since forking was disabled on [the original repository](https://github.com/developer9998/DevMinecraftMod), this version was created independently as a continuation of the project. The mod introduces Minecraft-inspired mechanics and features into Gorilla Tag, allowing players to create their own builds in Gorilla Tag.

## Features
- **Block Placement and Breaking**: Similar to Minecraft, players can place and destroy blocks when in lobbies.
- **Custom Textures**: Blocks and items use textures from Minecraft.
- **Collision Adjustments**: Adjustments have been made to improve compatibility with Gorilla Tagâ€™s collision system.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release of DevMinecraftMod-2025.
2. Ensure you have BepInEx installed for Gorilla Tag.
3. Create a folder for the mod in `BepInEx/plugins` and name it `DevMinecraftMod`.
3. Place the mod file into the `DevMinecraftMod` folder.
4. Launch Gorilla Tag and verify that the mod is working.
